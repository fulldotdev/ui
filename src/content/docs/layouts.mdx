# Layouts

Layouts are astro components that can be used to set the default styles for a page. They are located in the **src/content/layouts** directory.

## Creating a layout

Beside the layouts that are included in the library you can also create your own by adding a new astro component to the **src/content/layouts** directory. You can also override the existing layouts, see the <Link href="/guides/overriding-components/">overriding components</Link> guide for more information.

Currently there are 6 layouts included in the library:

- `Layout`
- `DocsLayout`
- `PostLayout`
- `ProductLayout`
- `BlockLayout`
- `ContactLayout`

## Applying a layout

To apply a preset to a page, you can add the `component` property to the frontmatter of a page.

```md
---
component: DocsLayout
---
```
