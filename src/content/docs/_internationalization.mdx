# Internationalization (i18n)

Getting started with i18n is easy, you can easily add additional languages by creating a new folder named after a language code in the **content/pages** directory and adding your content files in the new language.

These pages are just as static as the others however you can merge them with the default language by adding the `i18n` key to the frontmatter.

By merging pages you only need to specify the content that is different for the new language. Things like images do not need to be repeated in these new files. See example:

## Example

content/pages/index.md:

```md
---
sections:
  - component: Hero
    image: /image.webp
    heading: Page Title
    text: This is my page description
---
```

content/pages/nl/index.md:

```md
---
i18n: index

sections:
  - component: Hero
    heading: Page Title
    text: This is my page description
---
```

These return the same results

## Project structure

```bash
.
├── src/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   │   ├── index.md
│   │   │   ├── nl/
│   │   │   │   └── index.md
│   │   │   └── de/
│   │   │   │   └── index.md
```
