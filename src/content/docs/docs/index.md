In 6 years of running an agency building client projects we built up a nice collection of knowledge and patterns that we wanted to share with the community.

In this version we decided to make modifications so that fulldev/ui is compatible with shadcn/ui. This makes it more familiar to use and very nice to use with AI agents too!

Fulldev/ui is built with vanilla Astro components, without framework dependencies. It uses a similar API to shadcn/ui, but with a focus on content-first components like section, tile and prose. Give it a try and let us know what you think!
