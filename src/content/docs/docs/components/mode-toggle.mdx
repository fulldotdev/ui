description: A button component that toggles between light and dark theme modes.
---

```astro live
---
import { ModeToggle } from "@/components/ui/mode-toggle"
---

<ModeToggle />
```

## Installation

To install the mode toggle component, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @fulldev-ui/mode-toggle
```

## Usage

```ts
import { ModeToggle } from "@/components/ui/mode-toggle"
```

```astro
<ModeToggle />
```

## Features

- Automatically detects system preference
- Persists user preference in localStorage
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Accessible with proper aria labels

## How it works

The `ModeToggle` component:

1. Detects the user's system theme preference on first load
2. Applies the `dark` class to the `<html>` element when dark mode is active
3. Saves the user's preference to localStorage
4. Listens for clicks to toggle between light and dark modes
5. Ensures smooth transitions without jarring flashes

The component is intentionally self-contained with inline scripts to avoid flash of unstyled content (FOUC) when the page loads.
