```astro live

import { ThemeToggle } from "@/components/ui/theme-toggle"
---

<ThemeToggle />
```

## Installation

To install the Theme Toggle component, run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @fulldev-ui/theme-toggle
```

## Setup

The Theme Toggle requires the Theme Provider to be placed in your document's `<head>` to prevent flash of unstyled content (FOUC) and persist theme preferences.

Add the provider to your layout's head section:

```astro
---
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/ui/theme-toggle"
---

<html>
  <head>
    <ThemeProvider />
    <!-- other head elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- your content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Usage

```ts
import { ThemeToggle } from "@/components/ui/theme-toggle"
```

```astro
<ThemeToggle />
```
