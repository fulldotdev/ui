title: Icon
description: A component for displaying scalable vector icons.
---

The icon component utilizes Astro's rendering to be able to be any component, while not sacrificing performance.

Each icon in lucide-icons and simple-icons is supported. With duplicate names, lucide-icons takes precedence.

```astro live
---
import { Icon } from "@/components/ui/icon"
---

<Icon name="heart" />
<Icon name="star" />
<Icon name="check" />
<Icon name="trash-2" />
<Icon name="settings" />
```

## Installation

To install the icon component, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @fulldev-ui/icon
```

## Usage

```ts
import { Icon } from "@/components/ui/icon"
```

```astro
<Icon name="heart" />
```
