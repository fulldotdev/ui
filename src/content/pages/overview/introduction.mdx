# Introduction

**Fulldev UI** is a full-featured UI library and website theme built on the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework. Whether starting a new project or enhancing an existing one, this guide will help you get set up. For installation details, see the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation).

## Why we built it

We built **Fulldev UI** after repeatedly encountering the same challenges in client projects, covering the core needs of content-focused websites. Initially created for [our own company](https://full.dev), we decided to open-source it for others to use.

## Some features

- Vanilla HTML and CSS.
- Seamless integration with TailwindCSS and UnoCSS.
- Minimal JavaScript.
- Supports Astro's [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).
- Customizable via CSS variables.
- Reusable components for pages and sections.
- Includes blocks like Hero, CTA, Features, etc.
- Page-building tools.
- And more...

## A word of caution

**Fulldev UI** includes a wide range of features, some still experimental. While a narrower focus would improve stability, we built it for flexibility in our projects.

This isn't just a single-purpose library; it's a framework for building blog, marketing, and portfolio websitesâ€”similar to how [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) serves documentation. As it evolves, its focus will sharpen. In the meantime, feel free to use it and share feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fulldev)!
