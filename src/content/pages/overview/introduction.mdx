# Introduction

Fulldev UI focuses on content websites rather than applications.

##### Build entire websites with just components

Fulldev UI is unique in that it introduces larger components to build entire pages, and even websites. Like a Section component that just works.

##### Integrates with any JS / CSS framework

Want to use Tailwind, or something else? You can overwrite all styles. Need an interactive framework component? Styles can be applied with one simple class.

##### Automated colors, spacing and sizes

Everything is carefully designed to be fully responsive. Component adapt to their environment, like a Heading being different in a Section than in a Card. You can also customize via simple props.
