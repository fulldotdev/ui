# images

Adds type-safety and optimization for local images

## Features

- Type-safe image references
- Integrates with Astro's `<Image />` component
- Integrates even better with fulldev-ui's `<Image />` component
- Get images using the `getEntry()` helper function
- Define alt texts globally, so you don't have to repeat yourself

## Adding images

Image files added to the `src/images` directory will automatically be added to the images collection.

## Global alt texts

Alt texts can be defined globally in the same folder as where the images live. You create a `[IMAGE NAME].yml` in the same folder as the images.

This way you can define alt texts once and they will be used everyhwere you use the image. An example of such a `yaml` file would be:

```yaml
alt: 'A placeholder landscape image'
```

## Using images

### Automatic (recommended)
Use fulldev-ui's included `<Image />` component to get the following benefits out of the box:

- You only have to pass the image id
- Automatic type-safety and warnings
- Automatically uses global alt text
- Automatically optimizes image file

This is also the easiest way to use images:
```astro
---
import Image from 'fulldev-ui/components/Image.astro'
---

<Image id="my-image.png" />
```

### Manual

If you want more control over the image, you can use the `getEntry()` helper function to get an image.

```astro
---
import { getEntry } from 'fulldev-ui/utils'

const image = getEntry('my-image.png')
---
```

It will return an image in the following format:

```ts
{
  id: 'my-image.png',
  src: '/src/images/my-image.png',
  alt: 'Alt text provided via steps above',
  width: 1930,
  height: 1080,
  format: 'png'
}
```

You can pass these values directly into Astro's `<Image />` component to render the image.

```astro
---
import { getEntry } from 'fulldev-ui/utils'

const image = getEntry('my-image.png')
---

<Image {...image} />
```

But to get an optimized version, you should use an imported image instead:

```astro
---
import { getEntry } from 'fulldev-ui/utils'

const image = getEntry('my-image.png')
const images = import.meta.glob<{ default: ImageMetadata }>('/src/images/*')
const image = images[image.src]
---

<Image src={image()} alt={image.alt} />
```
