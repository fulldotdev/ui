# images

Adds type-safety and optimization for local images

## Features

- Type-safe image references
- Get images using the `getImage()` helper function
- Use local images in `src/images/[IMAGE NAME].[FILE EXTENSION]`
- Define alt texts globally in `src/content/images/[IMAGE NAME].yml`

## Adding images

Image files added to the `src/images` directory will automatically be added to the images collection.

## Global alt texts

Alt texts can be defined globally in the same folder as where the images live. You create a `[IMAGE NAME].yml` in the same folder as the images.

This way you can define alt texts once and they will be used everyhwere you use the image. An example of such a `yaml` file would be:

```yaml
alt: 'A placeholder landscape image'
```
