## Svelte, Vue React, etc.

While fulldev-ui is built with Tailwind CSS internally, all styles are converted to regular CSS classes using the `@apply` directive. This means all component styles are available globally through standard CSS classes.

You can use these component classes (like `button`, `variant-primary`, etc.) directly in any framework (Svelte, Vue, React, and all other frameworks), similar to how you would use other CSS frameworks like DaisyUI.

```astro live
---
import Button from 'fulldev-ui/components/Button.astro'
---

<button class="button size-md variant-primary">Button</button>
<Button>Button</Button>
```

## Shadcn/ui

As detailed in the [customization documentation](/overview/customization/), Fulldev UI shares the same styling variables as Shadcn/ui, ensuring complete compatibility between the two libraries.

This means you can seamlessly integrate Shadcn/ui components alongside Fulldev UI components while maintaining consistent styling and behavior.

## TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS comes pre-installed. You don't have to use it, but you can if you want to.
