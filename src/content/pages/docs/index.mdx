# Introduction

Everything you need to rapidly build content-driven websites. Components, blocks, layouts and complete page generation.

## Why we built it

After repeatedly encountering the same challenges in [our company's](https://full.dev) client projects, we decided to build this library. After successfully using it in production websites, we decided to open-source it to help others facing similar problems.

## What makes it special

- Built entirely with `.astro` components
- Outputs vanilla CSS, html and minimal JavaScript
- Compatible with all JS frameworks
- Compatible with Tailwind and Shadcn/ui
- Integrates with [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
- Blocks included, like Hero, CTA and Features
- Automatically generated pages
- And more...
