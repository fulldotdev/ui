# Collections

A general overview of how Astro's [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) are used.

## Types of content collections

1. `pages`: Used for generating pages and/or cards.
2. `presets`: Default values that can be referenced by pages
3. `images`: Adds type-safety and optimization for local images

## pages

Pages are automatically generated from files in `src/content/pages`. Use the `component` frontmatter property to specify which layout from `src/layouts` should render the page.

See the [pages collection reference](/collections/pages/) for details.

## presets

Presets define default values for pages and are stored in `src/content/presets`. Reference them in frontmatter using `presets: [your-preset-name]`, and their values will be merged with the page's frontmatter.

See the [presets collection reference](/collections/presets/) for details.

## images

The images collection provides type-safe and optimized local images. Alt tags can be defined globally and reused across multiple instances of the same image.

See the [images collection reference](/collections/images/) for details.
