# Using Images

With Fulldev-ui we offer a image component that can also be used with content collections. Local assets that are automatically optimized using `astro:image`. Whilst also keeping support for external images.

```astro
---
import Image from 'fulldev-ui/components/Image.astro'
---

{/* unoptimized image in public/images/ */}

<Image src="/images/placeholder-landscape.webp" />

{/* optimized image in public/images/ using astro:assets */}

<Image src="/images/placeholder-landscape.webp" width={600} height={400} />

{/* automatically optimized image in src/images/ using astro:assets */}

<Image src="placeholder-landscape.webp" />

{/* unoptimized external image */}

<Image src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400" />
```

## Using content collections

When an image is used locally, a yaml record will automatically be created in the **src/images** directory. This record will included an alt text generated from the filename and can be customized. The image component will use this record to set the alt text based on the name of the file, therefore you should not change the name of the yaml record.

For more information on how to use content collections, see the [images collection](/content-collections/images/) docs.
