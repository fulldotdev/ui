# Overriding Components

You can override components by creating a new component with the same name as one from the library in the **src/components** directory and adding your custom code. This also works for blocks and layouts.

For example, to override the `Hero` component, you can create a new `Hero.astro` file in the **src/blocks** directory and add your custom code.

If you now import the Hero from fulldev-ui, it will use your custom component instead. This is the same for components and layouts.

In content files it will also use your custom component if it exists.
