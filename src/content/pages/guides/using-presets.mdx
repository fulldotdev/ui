# Using Presets

Presets are configuration files that can be used to set the default values for a page. They are located in the **src/content/presets** directory and you can use them by adding the `preset` property to the frontmatter of a page or add a `basePreset` to the integration setup in the `astro.config.ts` file.

Presets can be applied to pages in the frontmatter or as a base preset.

## Creating a preset

Beside the presets that are included in the library you can also create your own by adding a new yaml file to the **src/content/presets** directory. See the [presets collection](/content-collections/presets/) for more information on what properties are available.

Currently there are 5 presets included in the library:

- `base`
- `docs`
- `blocks`

## Setting a preset

To apply a preset to a page, you can add the `preset` property to the frontmatter of a page.

```md
---
presets: [base, docs]
---
```

## Setting a base preset

To apply a preset to every page, you can set a `basePreset` in the integration setup in the `astro.config.ts` file therefore the base preset will not have to be added to the frontmatter anymore.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import fulldev from 'fulldev-ui/integration'

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    fulldev({
      // other options
      basePreset: 'base',
    }),
  ],
})
```
