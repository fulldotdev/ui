# Using Blocks

Blocks are astro components that can be used to create reusable content blocks. They are located in the **src/blocks** directory and you can use them by adding the `component` property to the frontmatter of a section in a page.

There are plenty of prestyled blocks included in the library, see the <Link href="/blocks/banner/">blocks examples</Link> for more information.

```yml
---
# Other options...

sections:
  - component: Hero # The block you want to use
    heading: Page Title
    text: This is my page description
    buttons:
      - text: Button
        color: brand
        href: /
      - text: Button
        href: /
---
```

## Creating a block

Beside the blocks that are included in the library you can also create your own by adding a new astro component to the **src/content/layouts** directory. You can also override the existing blocks, see the <Link href="/guides/overriding-components/">overriding components</Link> guide for more information.
