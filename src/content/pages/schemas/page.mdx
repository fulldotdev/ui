# Page Schema

Objects in the page schema are used to define the structure of a page. They are used to define the information, content and components that are used to render the page.

import { Code } from 'astro:components'
import Page from 'fulldev-ui/schemas/page.ts?raw'

<Code code={Page} lang="ts" />
