## Why we built it

After repeatedly encountering the same challenges in [our company's](https://full.dev) client projects, we decided to build this library. After successfully using it in production websites, we decided to open-source it to help others facing similar problems.

## Some features

- Built entirely with Astro components
- Outputs vanilla CSS, html and minimal JavaScript
- Compatible with all JS frameworks
- Compatible with Tailwind and Shadcn/ui
- Integrates with [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
- Blocks included, like Hero, CTA and Features
- Layouts included, like Docs, Post and Product
- Automatically generated pages
- And more...
