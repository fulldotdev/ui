## Regular usage

```astro live
---
import Hero1 from 'fulldev-ui/blocks/Hero1.astro'
---

<Hero1
  heading="Lorem ipsum dolor"
  paragraph="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur elit."
  buttons={[
    {
      text: 'Click me',
    },
    {
      text: 'Click me',
    },
  ]}
/>
```

## Dynamic page building

Blocks come with a utility component: `<Block />`. With this component you can dynamically render blocks to build pages.

This is powerful when combined with content collections or a CMS, as the person writing content can choose which block to use.

```astro live
---
import Block from 'fulldev-ui/components/Block.astro'
---

<Block
  block="Hero1"
  heading="Lorem ipsum dolor"
  paragraph="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur elit."
  buttons={[
    {
      text: 'Click me',
    },
    {
      text: 'Click me',
    },
  ]}
/>
```
