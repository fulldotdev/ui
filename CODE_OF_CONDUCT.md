# Contributor Code of Conduct
We accept and encourage everyone's contributions. It doesn't matter how you look, how you feel, where you're from, or anything like that. In fact, we won't bring it up, or ask.

We are here to build great software, to learn, to grow, and to help each other. Maybe make some friends along the way.

If you have any questions, please reach out!
